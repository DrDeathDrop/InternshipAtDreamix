1) DDL — Data Definition Language

Definition:
DDL commands define and modify database structure — tables, schemas, indexes, etc. These commands affect the metadata and structure of database objects.

-- Commands and Syntaxes
CREATE 
    -- Create a new database object
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        column1 DATA_TYPE,
        column2 DATA_TYPE,
        ...
    );

DROP 
    -- Delete an existing object
    DROP TABLE table_name;

ALTER 
    -- Change structure of an existing object
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD COLUMN column_name DATA_TYPE;

TRUNCATE 
    -- Remove all records from a table
    TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

COMMENT 
    -- Add comment to database object
    COMMENT ON TABLE table_name IS 'Your comment';

RENAME 
    -- Rename an existing object
    RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;


Example:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE
);


This creates the employees table with four columns.

2) DQL — Data Query Language

Definition:
DQL is used to retrieve/fetch data from the database. The main command is SELECT. Other keywords like FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and LIMIT are clauses of the SELECT query.

-- DQL Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column [ASC | DESC]
LIMIT number;


Example:

SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales'
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;


This fetches employee names and hire dates from the employees table in the Sales department, sorted by most recent hire date.

3) DML — Data Manipulation Language

Definition:
DML commands manipulate the data within tables: inserting, updating, or deleting records.

-- DML Commands and Syntax
INSERT
    -- Insert a new record
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
    VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

UPDATE
    -- Modify existing records
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = new_value
    WHERE condition;

DELETE
    -- Remove records
    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;


Example:

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department)
VALUES ('Jane', 'Smith', 'HR');


Inserts a new HR employee into the table.

4) DCL — Data Control Language

Definition:
DCL commands manage permissions and access control — granting and revoking user privileges.

-- DCL Syntax
GRANT privilege_type
    ON object_name
    TO user_name
    [WITH GRANT OPTION];

REVOKE privilege_type
    ON object_name
    FROM user_name;


Example:

GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON employees TO user_name;


This gives user_name permission to select and update data in the employees table.

5) TCL — Transaction Control Language

Definition:
TCL commands manage transactions, ensuring changes are committed or rolled back as a unit.

-- TCL Commands and Syntax
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Start a transaction

COMMIT;
    -- Save all changes permanently

ROLLBACK;
    -- Undo all changes since last commit

SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
    -- Create a savepoint within a transaction


Example:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE employees SET department = 'Marketing' WHERE department = 'Sales';
SAVEPOINT before_update;
UPDATE employees SET department = 'IT' WHERE department = 'HR';
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_update;
COMMIT;


This example starts a transaction, updates departments, uses a savepoint, rolls back to that point if needed, and commits the change
